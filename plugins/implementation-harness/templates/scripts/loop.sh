# harness-loop-variant: worktree   # read by implementation-harness-upgrade to pick the right reference — do not remove
#
# loop.sh — the single SEQUENTIAL "Ralph loop" that builds a TASKS.json backlog.
#
# Exactly ONE task is built at a time, fully verified, and merged into `main` only on
# green GitHub CI — so an interruption (token limit, crash) can ever damage at most one
# task. See .harness/docs/HARNESS.md for the full design and rationale.
#
# ISOLATION (why this uses a worktree even though it's sequential):
#   The machine is shared — other agents, a running app, or manual edits may all live in
#   the primary checkout. So the loop NEVER works in the primary checkout. It:
#     • reads its task decisions from `origin/main` (the integrated truth, branch-agnostic),
#     • does every task's build in its OWN dedicated sibling worktree (../<repo>-loop),
#     • integrates by fast-forwarding `main` via push — WHILE BUILDING it never checks `main` out anywhere.
#   The only shared state it writes is the git ref db (fetch/worktree/branch) and its lock.
#   ONCE THE BACKLOG IS DRAINED and the loop exits cleanly, it optionally leaves your PRIMARY checkout on
#   the latest `main` — a convenience so your local copy reflects everything that just landed. This is the
#   one time it touches the primary checkout, and it's SAFE + best-effort: it skips a dirty tree (never
#   clobbers uncommitted work), fast-forwards only, and is non-fatal. See sync_primary_checkout(); disable
#   with SYNC_PRIMARY_ON_DONE=0.
#
# CONCURRENCY GUARD:
#   A lock in the shared .git ensures two `loop.sh` instances can't run at once (the
#   second exits immediately). Combined with the worktree isolation above, the loop is
#   safe to run while other work happens on the box.
#
# Each iteration:
#   SELECT (shell)  — from origin/main: the next not-done task whose Depends-on are all done
#                     and which is NOT a 🔒 needs-human / blocked task. None → stop.
#   WORK   (claude) — one `claude -p` at the policy-chosen tier (facets + the outcomes ledger pick
#                     the cheapest model that reliably builds this kind of task; cold-start floor =
#                     harness.env) builds that task in a FRESH isolated worktree on branch `tNNN`
#                     (rebuilt COLD each attempt), runs the Definition of Done, commits, pushes.
#   GATE   (shell)  — watch the branch's CI; green → audit → fast-forward `main` (push) and tear the
#                     worktree/branch down; red / audit-fail → a failed attempt (tear down → COLD retry).
#
# Usage:  .harness/scripts/loop.sh [TNNN]  # optional: force a specific task id this run
#         .harness/scripts/loop.sh --guard-selftest [path]  # verify the guard regex (or test one path), then exit
#         .harness/scripts/loop.sh --scope-exempt-selftest [globs path]  # verify SCOPE_EXEMPT_GLOBS matching, then exit
#         .harness/scripts/loop.sh --scope-selftest [entry file]  # verify scope-entry matching (extension globs), then exit
#         .harness/scripts/loop.sh --rl-selftest detect|wait …    # verify usage-limit detection + reset parsing, then exit
# Extend: drop scripts under .harness/custom/hooks/ (on-<event>.sh) and patterns in

# terminal — never something an agent decides on its own initiative (an interactive session
# "helpfully" spinning up the loop for an unrelated request, or a builder task recursively
# starting another loop instance mid-build). Claude Code sets CLAUDECODE=1 in every Bash tool
# subprocess it spawns, regardless of session mode (-p / interactive, --dangerously-skip-

Obey CLAUDE.md, .harness/tracking/TASKS.json, and .harness/docs/HARNESS.md exactly. You run
head-less and unattended. First read CLAUDE.md (conventions) and README.md (the current implemented state).

1. BUILD COLD. You are starting FRESH on a clean branch off origin/main — do NOT look for or rely on
   any prior-attempt state (worklog, partial commits); build this task from the spec alone. Read this
   task's object in .harness/tracking/TASKS.json (find it with `jq '.tasks[]|select(.id=="<TASK>")'
   .harness/tracking/TASKS.json`); if its `design` field points to a `.harness/docs/designs/…` doc,
   READ and follow it. The task's `do` + `done-when` live in the Markdown spec at the JSON `spec`
   path (.harness/tasks/<TASK>.md, sections '## Do' / '## Done when') — its FULL TEXT is appended at
   the end of this prompt. Stay within the task's `scope` — the exact allowed-files list + the
   HARD-GATE rule are shown under "SCOPE" at the end of this prompt.
2. DEFINITION OF DONE (.harness/docs/HARNESS.md §5 — all must hold before you report `done`):
   a. Run the project's full verification suite exactly as defined in CLAUDE.md /
      .harness/docs/HARNESS.md §5 (format, lint, tests, build). These MIRROR CI — if CI runs it,
      run it locally first. Every check must pass.
   b. Run the task's relevant integration / end-to-end tests when their preconditions are
      met. Tests that need credentials, funds, or external resources you don't have: leave
      them as they are and record `failed:blocked` if the task's core needs them — never
      silently skip a required check and call it "passed".
   c. If the task's `verify` field names extra EMPIRICAL checks (e.g. run the app against
      real input for a bounded window and observe it behaves), perform them and record what
      you OBSERVED in the worklog. The bar is the behaviour the task specifies.
3. DO NOT edit .harness/tracking/TASKS.json — the loop, not the builder, sets `"status"` to `"done"`
   itself once your build clears the structural checks + audit gate below, in a follow-up commit
   the loop makes on its own. If a doc (README.md, .harness/docs/LIMITATIONS.md, …) genuinely needs
   updating for THIS task, update it only if it's listed in your `scope` below — otherwise leave it.
4. COMMIT — produce EXACTLY ONE commit for the whole task, `<TASK>: <summary>` (INCLUDING
   `.harness/worklog/<TASK>.md` with a dated entry: what you did, checks run, what remains). If you iterate,
   fold changes into that SAME commit with `git commit --amend` — do NOT stack multiple commits (the loop
   integrates a task as one commit). Then push THIS branch: `git push -u origin HEAD`. Do NOT merge
   into `main` — the loop watches GitHub CI and fast-forwards main on green. If a previous
   push's CI for this branch failed, run `gh run view --log-failed` and fix the cause first.
5. As your FINAL action, OVERWRITE `.harness/worklog/.result` with exactly ONE line:
     done <TASK> <branch>                 # built, committed, pushed — ready for CI + merge
     failed:soft <TASK> <reason>          # transient / partial — retry is worthwhile
     failed:blocked <TASK> <reason>       # needs-human / unmet prereq — do NOT retry
     waiting <TASK> <unmet-deps>          # a dependency is not merged yet
     idle                                 # nothing to do for this task

# buffered dump at process exit (plain -p mode never streams to a pipe — confirmed empirically: a
# 500-word response sat at a flat byte count for the entire generation, then landed in a single write
# right as the process exited). The raw event stream goes to `.claude-out.<phase>.jsonl` (what the
# dashboard tails live, per phase); `.claude-out.<phase>` itself is reconstructed via jq into PLAIN
# TEXT and keeps its role from before phase-separation — every existing consumer (RL_HARD_RE/RL_RE
# below, rl_reset_wait's reset-time parsing, the audit's PASS/FAIL grep, the worklog .audit.md copy)
# just needed its path updated to the phase-specific file, not its logic.
#
# `<phase>` is load-bearing, not cosmetic: build and audit used to share ONE fixed filename, so the
# very first byte of the audit's output truncated (via `tee`) the builder's still-fresh output before
# a human ever saw it. Per-phase files mean both stay readable independently until their own NEXT run.
#
# The jq extraction MUST be `-R … | fromjson? | …`, not the naive `select(...)` on parsed JSON input:
# `2>&1` means an occasional non-JSON stderr line can land mid-stream, and plain `jq 'select(...)'`
# treats one parse error as fatal — SILENTLY DROPPING every text_delta after that point for the rest
# of the invocation (confirmed empirically). `-R` (read each line as a raw string) + `fromjson?` (the
# `?` turns a parse failure into `empty` for just that line) skips a bad line and keeps going.

You are an INDEPENDENT AUDITOR. You did NOT write this code and you carry NO prior context. Another
agent implemented task $id; your ONLY job is to judge whether the implementation genuinely satisfies
the task's "## Done when" criteria below.

Respond with EXACTLY one word on the FIRST LINE: PASS or FAIL. Then, on following lines, give concise
reasons. PASS only if the diff meets EVERY "## Done when" item for real. FAIL if any item is unmet,
faked, stubbed, or only superficially addressed. Be strict — do not give the benefit of the doubt.
